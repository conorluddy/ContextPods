# LLM Sampling and Integration Examples

This example demonstrates how to integrate Large Language Model capabilities with MCP servers using the sampling pattern.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Sampling Requests** - Creating and managing LLM sampling requests
- **Model Integration** - Working with different LLM models
- **Content Analysis** - Using LLMs for text analysis and processing
- **Content Generation** - Generating text, code, and other content
- **Token Management** - Handling token usage and optimization

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Text Analysis with LLM
Leverage LLM capabilities for sentiment analysis, summarization, and content classification.

### 2. Code Generation and Review
Use LLMs to generate code snippets and perform code reviews.

### 3. Content Enhancement
Improve and enhance existing content with LLM assistance.

## Running the Example

```bash
# From the template root directory
npm run example:sampling

# Run with different model configurations
node examples/sampling/model-demo.js
```

## Key Concepts

- Sampling allows MCP servers to leverage external LLM capabilities
- Use appropriate model preferences for different tasks
- Handle token usage efficiently for cost optimization
- Implement proper error handling for LLM interactions
- Consider response caching for repeated queries

## Model Configuration

The examples show how to configure different models for different tasks:
- **Fast models** for simple analysis
- **Capable models** for complex reasoning
- **Specialized models** for code generation
