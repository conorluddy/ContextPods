# Issue Enhancement Command

You are tasked with analyzing a GitHub issue and enhancing it with comprehensive specifications based on repository context, recent activity, and best practices.

## Parameters

- **Issue Number**: The GitHub issue number that was just opened (available via GitHub Actions context)

## Enhancement Process

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis

1. **Current Issue Understanding**: Analyze the issue description to understand:
   - The core problem or feature request
   - Any existing requirements or constraints mentioned
   - The scope and complexity implied
   - User's intent and expected outcomes

2. **Repository Context Analysis**: Examine the repository to understand:
   - Current codebase architecture and patterns
   - Recent commits and their impact (last 10-20 commits)
   - Recent pull requests and changes
   - Development conventions and standards from CLAUDE.md
   - Existing similar functionality or patterns

3. **Technical Assessment**: Evaluate:
   - How the request fits into current architecture
   - Dependencies and integration points
   - Potential impact on existing functionality
   - Technical complexity and implementation approach

### Phase 2: Specification Enhancement

#### Create Comprehensive Specifications Including:

**1. Problem Statement**

- Clear, detailed problem definition
- Context within the larger system
- Impact and importance

**2. Technical Requirements**

- Specific functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Integration requirements with existing systems
- API or interface specifications if applicable

**3. Implementation Approach**

- Recommended technical approach and architecture
- Key components or modules to be affected
- Code organization and file structure considerations
- Dependencies and libraries needed

**4. Acceptance Criteria**

- Specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Definition of "done" for this issue
- Success metrics and validation approaches

**5. Testing Strategy**

- Unit testing requirements
- Integration testing needs
- E2E or manual testing considerations
- Test coverage expectations (>90% per repository standards)

**6. Documentation Requirements**

- Code documentation needs (docblocks, comments)
- User documentation updates
- API documentation if applicable

**7. Implementation Considerations**

- Breaking changes assessment
- Migration requirements
- Rollback strategies
- Performance implications

**8. Related Issues and Dependencies**

- Links to related issues or PRs
- Dependencies on other work
- Potential conflicts with ongoing development

### Phase 3: Output Format

Append the enhanced specifications to the issue description with the following format:

## 🔄 Interactive Iteration

This issue supports interactive refinement with Claude:

- **💬 Chat**: Comment with `@claude` to discuss implementation details
- **🔄 Refine**: Comment with `🔄 refine` to polish and clarify specifications
- **🦖 Evolve**: Comment with `🦖 evolve` to creatively expand the idea
- **⭐ Finalize**: Comment with `⭐ finalize` to replace this description with your preferred iteration

All iterations will appear as comments and can be promoted to the main description when ready.

---

## 🚀 Auto-Implementation

Once this issue is fully specified and ready for development:

- **🚀 Implement**: Comment with `🚀 implement` to automatically create a branch, implement the solution, and open a pull request
- **Alternative triggers**: `implement` or `start work` also trigger auto-implementation

**What happens during auto-implementation:**
1. **Analysis**: Claude analyzes the issue specifications and repository context
2. **Planning**: Creates detailed implementation plan with atomic tasks
3. **Branch & PR**: Creates feature branch and draft pull request with progress tracking
4. **Development**: Implements solution incrementally with tests and documentation
5. **Quality**: Validates all quality gates (tests, lint, build, type-check)
6. **Review**: Marks PR ready for review with comprehensive testing instructions

The entire implementation follows repository standards and maintains >90% test coverage.
```

## Command Execution

The workflow will:

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Use `git log` and `gh pr list` to analyze recent repository activity
3. Analyze the codebase structure and patterns
4. Generate comprehensive specifications
5. Use `gh issue edit` to append the enhanced specifications to the issue description

## Quality Standards

- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects from requirements to testing
- **Actionable**: Provide clear, implementable guidance
- **Context-Aware**: Integrate with existing repository patterns and conventions
- **Professional**: Use clear, professional language suitable for development planning
- **Realistic**: Ensure recommendations are feasible within the current codebase

## Success Criteria

- Issue description is enhanced with comprehensive specifications
- All technical aspects are covered (requirements, testing, documentation)
- Implementation approach aligns with repository conventions
- Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- Related work and dependencies are identified

Remember: The goal is to transform a basic issue description into a comprehensive specification that any developer could use to implement the feature or fix with confidence.
